# popular_logs 
Simple script that knocked me out
read a logfile ie `*ishma.log*`
with the format:  
`<time><host_name><user_id><ishma_id><action>`  
#action can be load or save
ie:  
  `12:30 ishma.com 78 6592 load`  
  `12:30 ishma.com 7 6592 save`  
  `12:30 ishma.com 98 6591 load`  
  `12:30 ishma.com 38 6590 load`
Was supposed to write a script to get the top ten most popular logs
